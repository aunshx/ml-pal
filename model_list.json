It builds hierarchical feature maps by merging image patches (shown in gray) in deeper layers and has linear computation complexity to input image size due to computation of self-attention only within each local window (shown in red). It can thus serve as a general-purpose backbone for both image classification and dense recognition tasks.

It was introduced in the paperEnd-to-End Object Detection with Transformersby Carion et al. and first released inthis repository.Disclaimer: The team releasing DETR did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.Model descriptionThe DETR model is an encoder-decoder transformer with a convolutional backbone. Two heads are added on top of the decoder outputs in order to perform object detection: a linear layer for the class labels and a MLP (multi-layer perceptron) for the bounding boxes. The model uses so-called object queries to detect objects in an image. Each object query looks for a particular object in the image. For COCO, the number of object queries is set to 100.The model is trained using a \"bipartite matching loss\": one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a \"no object\" as class and \"no bounding box\" as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.Intended uses & limitationsYou can use the raw model for object detection.

        "Model Overview": "BERT base model (uncased)Pretrained model on English language using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective. It was introduced inthis paperand first released inthis repository. This model is uncased: it does not make a difference\nbetween english and English.Disclaimer: The team releasing BERT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by\nthe Hugging Face team.Model descriptionBERT is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This means it\nwas pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labeling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of\npublicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. More precisely, it\nwas pretrained with two objectives:Masked language modeling (MLM): taking a sentence, the model randomly masks 15% of the words in the input then run\nthe entire masked sentence through the model and has to predict the masked words. This is different from traditional\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs) that usually see the words one after the other, or from autoregressive models like\nGPT which internally masks the future tokens. It allows the model to learn a bidirectional representation of the\nsentence.Next sentence prediction (NSP): the models concatenates two masked sentences as inputs during pretraining. Sometimes\nthey correspond to sentences that were next to each other in the original text, sometimes not. The model then has to\npredict if the two sentences were following each other or not.This way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features\nuseful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled sentences, for instance, you can train a standard\nclassifier using the features produced by the BERT model as inputs.Model variationsBERT has originally been released in base and large variations, for cased and uncased input text. The uncased models also strips out an accent markers.Chinese and multilingual uncased and cased versions followed shortly after.Modified preprocessing with whole word masking has replaced subpiece masking in a following work, with the release of two models.Other 24 smaller models are released afterward.The detailed release history can be found on thegoogle-research/bert readmeon github.Model#paramsLanguagebert-base-uncased110MEnglishbert-large-uncased340MEnglishbert-base-cased110MEnglishbert-large-cased340MEnglishbert-base-chinese110MChinesebert-base-multilingual-cased110MMultiplebert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking340MEnglishbert-large-cased-whole-word-masking340MEnglishIntended uses & limitationsYou can use the raw model for either masked language modeling or next sentence prediction, but it's mostly intended to\nbe fine-tuned on a downstream task. See themodel hubto look for\nfine-tuned versions of a task that interests you.Note that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked)\nto make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification or question answering.

The inputs of the model are\nthen of the form:[CLS] Sentence A [SEP] Sentence B [SEP]With probability 0.5, sentence A and sentence B correspond to two consecutive sentences in the original corpus, and in\nthe other cases, it's another random sentence in the corpus. Note that what is considered a sentence here is a\nconsecutive span of text usually longer than a single sentence. The only constrain is that the result with the two\n\"sentences\" has a combined length of less than 512 tokens.The details of the masking procedure for each sentence are the following:15% of the tokens are masked.In 80% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by[MASK].In 10% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by a random token (different) from the one they replace.In the 10% remaining cases, the masked tokens are left as is.PretrainingThe model was trained on 4 cloud TPUs in Pod configuration (16 TPU chips total) for one million steps with a batch size\nof 256. The sequence length was limited to 128 tokens for 90% of the steps and 512 for the remaining 10%.

Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.Carbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative7.7M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type H100-80GB (TDP of 700W). Estimated total emissions were 2290 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta\u2019s sustainability program.Time (GPU hours)Power Consumption (W)Carbon Emitted(tCO2eq)Llama 3 8B1.3M700390Llama 3 70B6.4M7001900Total7.7M2290CO2 emissions during pre-training. Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.Training DataOverviewLlama 3 was pretrained on over 15 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over 10M human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.Data FreshnessThe pretraining data has a cutoff of March 2023 for the 8B and December 2023 for the 70B models respectively.BenchmarksIn this section, we report the results for Llama 3 models on standard automatic benchmarks.

We are committed to Responsible AI development and took a series of steps to limit misuse and harm and support the open source community.Foundation models are widely capable technologies that are built to be used for a diverse range of applications. They are not designed to meet every developer preference on safety levels for all use cases, out-of-the-box, as those by their nature will differ across different applications.Rather, responsible LLM-application deployment is achieved by implementing a series of safety best practices throughout the development of such applications, from the model pre-training, fine-tuning and the deployment of systems composed of safeguards to tailor the safety needs specifically to the use case and audience.As part of the Llama 3 release, we updated ourResponsible Use Guideto outline the steps and best practices for developers to implement model and system level safety for their application. We also provide a set of resources includingMeta Llama Guard 2andCode Shieldsafeguards. These tools have proven to drastically reduce residual risks of LLM Systems, while maintaining a high level of helpfulness. We encourage developers to tune and deploy these safeguards according to their needs and we provide areference implementationto get you started.Llama 3-InstructAs outlined in the Responsible Use Guide, some trade-off between model helpfulness and model alignment is likely unavoidable. Developers should exercise discretion about how to weigh the benefits of alignment and helpfulness for their specific use case and audience. Developers should be mindful of residual risks when using Llama models and leverage additional safety tools as needed to reach the right safety bar for their use case.SafetyFor our instruction tuned model, we conducted extensive red teaming exercises, performed adversarial evaluations and implemented safety mitigations techniques to lower residual risks. As with any Large Language Model, residual risks will likely remain and we recommend that developers assess these risks in the context of their use case. In parallel, we are working with the community to make AI safety benchmark standards transparent, rigorous and interpretable.RefusalsIn addition to residual risks, we put a great emphasis on model refusals to benign prompts. Over-refusing not only can impact the user experience but could even be harmful in certain contexts as well. We\u2019ve heard the feedback from the developer community and improved our fine tuning to ensure that Llama 3 is significantly less likely to falsely refuse to answer prompts than Llama 2.We built internal benchmarks and developed mitigations to limit false refusals making Llama 3 our most helpful model to date.Responsible releaseIn addition to responsible use considerations outlined above, we followed a rigorous process that requires us to take extra measures against misuse and critical risks before we make our release decision.MisuseIf you access or use Llama 3, you agree to the Acceptable Use Policy. The most recent copy of this policy can be found athttps://llama.meta.com/llama3/use-policy/.Critical risksCBRNE(Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high yield Explosives)We have conducted a two fold assessment of the safety of the model in this area:Iterative testing during model training to assess the safety of responses related to CBRNE threats and other adversarial risks.Involving external CBRNE experts to conduct an uplift test assessing the ability of the model to accurately provide expert knowledge and reduce barriers to potential CBRNE misuse, by reference to what can be achieved using web search (without the model).Cyber SecurityWe have evaluated Llama 3 with CyberSecEval, Meta\u2019s cybersecurity safety eval suite, measuring Llama 3\u2019s propensity to suggest insecure code when used as a coding assistant, and Llama 3\u2019s propensity to comply with requests to help carry out cyber attacks, where attacks are defined by the industry standard MITRE ATT&CK cyber attack ontology. On our insecure coding and cyber attacker helpfulness tests, Llama 3 behaved in the same range or safer than models ofequivalent coding capability.Child SafetyChild Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the model\u2019s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through Llama 3 model development.  For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth sessions using objective based methodologies to assess the model risks along multiple attack vectors. We also partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.CommunityGenerative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership in AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Purple Llama tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to ourGithub repository.Finally, we put in place a set of resources including anoutput reporting mechanismandbug bounty programto continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.Ethical Considerations and LimitationsThe core values of Llama 3 are openness, inclusivity and helpfulness. It is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 3 addresses users and their needs as they are, without insertion unnecessary judgment or normativity, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the dignity and autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.But Llama 3 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 3\u2019s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 3 models, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model. As outlined in the Responsible Use Guide, we recommend incorporatingPurple Llamasolutions into your workflows and specificallyLlama Guardwhich provides a base model to filter input and output prompts to layer system-level safety on top of model-level safety.Please see the Responsible Use Guide available athttp://llama.meta.com/responsible-use-guideCitation instructions@article{llama3modelcard,title={Llama 3 Model Card},author={AI@Meta},year={2024},url = {https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/blob/main/MODEL_CARD.md}}ContributorsAaditya Singh;

The model is trained using \"teacher forcing\" on a lot of (image, text) pairs.The goal for the model is simply to predict the next text token, giving the image tokens and previous text tokens.The model has full access to (i.e. a bidirectional attention mask is used for) the image patch tokens, but only has access to the previous text tokens (i.e. a causal attention mask is used for the text tokens) when predicting the next text token.This allows the model to be used for tasks like:image and video captioningvisual question answering (VQA) on images and videoseven image classification (by simply conditioning the model on the image and asking it to generate a class for it in text).Intended uses & limitationsYou can use the raw model for image captioning.

        "Model Overview": "BLIP: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training for Unified Vision-Language Understanding and GenerationModel card for image captioning pretrained on COCO dataset - base architecture (with ViT large backbone).Pull figure from BLIP official repoTL;DRAuthors from thepaperwrite in the abstract:Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) has advanced the performance for many vision-language tasks. However, most existing pre-trained models only excel in either understanding-based tasks or generation-based tasks. Furthermore, performance improvement has been largely achieved by scaling up the dataset with noisy image-text pairs collected from the web, which is a suboptimal source of supervision. In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6% in VQA score). BLIP also demonstrates strong generalization ability when directly transferred to videolanguage tasks in a zero-shot manner.
